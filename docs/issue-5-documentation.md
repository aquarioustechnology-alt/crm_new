# Issue #5: Friendly Lead Notification System

## üìã **Issue Description**
**Title**: Friendly nudges for "stale" leads with missing/aging comments

**Original Request**:
> I want the system to give some real fun notifications when a new lead is added and there is no comment on that. We can say, "Hey, so big", "Hey Rana, add that first comment" or something which is very intuitive and personal or friendly by "Hey buddy, add your first comment".
>
> And again, if a comment is already added and in the next two or three days, no more new comments are added, then also we want to check and give some fun notifications. What's up? Why is the project not moving or something which is more friendly?
>
> Notification Channels: toast with action option
>
> First comment nudges: "Hey buddy, kick things off on {lead_title} with a quick note."
>
> Stale follow-ups: "Friendly poke üëã ‚Äî {lead_title} hasn't moved in {days_since} days. What's the plan?"
>
> Edge Cases: If lead is Closed/Won/Lost, stop stale checks.
